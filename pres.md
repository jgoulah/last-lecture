# Some Engineering History

---

## chbranch

^ cli wrapper that did a bunch of crap (some put things in weird states)

^ totally synchronous, can only load dev web site OR run tests

---

![left](images/buildbot.jpg)

# buildbot

^ pretty much always failing 

^ there was a command ,rebuildreds

---

![fit](images/buildbot-monitors.jpg)

^ this was an example of our monitors (oct 2010)

^ sprouter - another piece of technology that we should pretend never happened

---

# #push

^ push was a thing but only bots, the conversation was all in #hardware

^ we didn't move to using push for talking to each other, or using the topic or pushbot until later

---

![fit](images/deployinator.jpg)

---

# developer vm's

^ all the vm’s on one machine (100 vm’s)

^ hand rolled (create dns entries manually, run some janky script, do more manual stuff, etc)

---

![fit](images/evolution.jpg)

# Slow Evolution

^ brought in to work on API but started working more and more on our deploys and tools

^ https://www.etsy.com/listing/162827113/modern-abstract-painting-evolution

---

![fit](images/deploys-2011.png)

^ suddenly things started clicking, heres how that happened

---

## using #push topic to coordinate

^ push trains in the topic and status

^ soon pushbot thanks to asm, just appeared one day

---

# deleted buildbot tests

^ introduced "hudson" (now jenkins)

---

# supergrep

^ first iteration, chad, etc

---

# SVN to Git

^ took about 6 months - a lot of work and restructuring the repo and training the org

^ this is what influenced using git rebase (rpull)

---

# virtual madness

^ first self serve internal cloud

^ across scalable cluster of physical hosts

---

# bobs

^ on the autobots side the bobs were born

^ bobs are the virtual containers that CI runs on

^ gave us the ability to run many try jobs and parallelize builds

---

![fit](images/devtools.jpg)

^ and dev tools manifested around this time

---

# autobots

![fit](images/autobots.png)

---

# Random Projects

---

# market expansion plans

^ 2012 (my attempt at the product world)

---

![fit](images/musiconetsy.jpg)

^ wrote a detailed 13 page proposal if you are interested

^ russ, hersh, tim holley, justin s.

# dev proxy

# kegerator

![fit](images/kegerator.jpg)

---

# Parting Thoughts 

---

# delete a meeting

^ yes, do it now, especially if its a 1:1 in a conference room

---

# technical debt 

^ our technical debt limit is too high, we aren't factoring in cleanup time if we jump from project to project with tight deadlines

^ flexible deadlines

---

# move around a lot

^ don't get too comfortable

---

# talk to people 

^ eng should increase the rate of communication with other orgs and be proactive

---

# bike to work

^ its awesome

---

![fit](images/elephant-rider.jpg)

^ concept originated in happiness hypothesis by jonathon haidt

^ humans have two sides, have to balance

^ An emotional/automatic/irrational side (the elephant)

^ An analytical/controlled/rational side (its rider).
