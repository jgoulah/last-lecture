---

![fit](images/buildbot-monitors.jpg)

^ this was an example of our monitors (oct 2010)

# #push

^ push was a thing but no topic or coordination, sometimes not even talking, just triggering pushes, mostly bot chatter

---

# developer vm's

^ all the vm’s on one machine (100 vm’s) 

^ hand rolled (create dns entries manually, run some janky script, do more manual stuff, etc)
